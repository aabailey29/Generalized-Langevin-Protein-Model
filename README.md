# Generalized-Langevin-Protein-Model
Master's thesis work on modeling the movement of the KRas protein, a protein associated with many human cancers. 

Description: This project includes code that generates simulated molecular dynamics protein data used for fitting an integral kernel in our GLE model. The GLE model is then validated with real KRas protein data from LLNL.

sim_MD_VACF runs molecular dynamics code to generate simulated protein data used for model fitting. The data is given in the form of a Velocity Auto Correlation Function (VACF)
